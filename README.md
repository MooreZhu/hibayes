## Individual and summary level data based BAYES model for Genome-Wide Association and Genomic Prediction

```hibayes``` is an user-friendly [R](https://www.r-project.org) package to fit BAYES model using individual-level data and summary-level data for both Genomic prediction/selection and Genome-Wide association study, it was desighed to estimate joint effects and genetic parameters for a complex trait, including 1)genetic variance, 2)residual variance, 3)heritability, 4)joint distribution of effect size, 5)phenotype/genetic variance explained (PVE) for single or multiple SNPs, and 6)posterior probability of association of the genomic window (WPPA). The functions are not limited, we will keep on going in enriching ```hibayes``` with more features.

```hibayes``` is developed by [Lilin Yin](https://github.com/YinLiLin) with the support of [Haohao Zhang](https://github.com/hyacz), [Xiaolei Liu](https://github.com/XiaoleiLiuBio), [Jian Zeng](http://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/14033) at [Jian Yang](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/2713). If you have any bug reports or questions, please send an email to Lilin Yin ([ylilin@163.com](mailto:ylilin@163.com)).

## Installation
```hibayes``` can be installed from GitHub as folowing, please ensure ```devtools``` has been installed prior to ```hibayes```.
```r
> devtools::install_github("YinLiLin/hibayes")
```
The package is on its way to R CRAN, and it would be coming soon.
